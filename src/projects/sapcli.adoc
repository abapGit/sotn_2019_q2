==== Description

Leverages ADT HTTP API to allow executing ABAP development operations without
human interaction in order to enable high level of scripting and integration
with tools like Jenkins, Jira, or GitHub.

Use case examples::
  * Triggering quality checks (ABAP Unit, ATC) from CI tools
  * Automating CTS operations (e.g. releasing transports after GitHub review)
  * Deploying ABAP Objects from git repositories created by abapGit

Inspired by OpenStackClient, AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Kubectl, Cloud Foundry CLI and
many other command line tools used by IT professionals to automate their tasks
and work efficiently from command line.
